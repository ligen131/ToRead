# ToRead

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?down_message=offline&up_color=green&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftr.lg.gl)](https://tr.lg.gl)

A simple Read-It-Later and link collection tool, AI-powered for text and images, multi-platform, open-source. A browser extension available for one-click bookmarking.

Demo deployed at <https://tr.lg.gl>

API document: <https://github.com/ligen131/ToRead/blob/main/backend/docs/api.md>

API Endpoint: <https://to-read.lg.gl/api/v1>

**Integrate ToRead into your application with just one line of code**:

```shell
$ curl https://g.lg.gl --data '{"url": "https://lg.gl"}'
```

The url field can be any publicly accessible link. Please note that some content requiring CAPTCHA verification or with restricted permissions may not be accessible. This endpoint may be slow to response.

This project was my undergraduate thesis at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). The current implementation is relatively simple and still has several bugs. The backend currently has no rate limiting or security checks, so please use it within a limited scope.

If you like this project, please give it a Star! ‚≠ê
